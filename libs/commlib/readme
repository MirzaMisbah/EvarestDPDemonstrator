/****
	COMM LIB
	Using WebRTC	

	Libversion: 0.2
	STABLE: NO
	DOCUMENTED: NO
	BUGGY: YES
	
	This library is still under developement and is subject to change. 

	
***/

Files:
1. testCommConfig.html: an html file that uses the communication library. Use it as a guide on how to use the library. (Out of Date)

2. lib/peerComm.js: this file contains the library core functions. It communicates with the signaling server and the target peers.

3. lib/logger.js: has helper logging functions.

4. lib/server.js: a compatible signaling server. Must be deployed in order for the peer communication to succeed.



Dependencies:
 			The signaling server must be up and running before the communication takes place
 
Limitations:
 			At the moment the communication can succeed IFF both peers are on the same WLAN/LAN
 
Usage Instructions: 
			In order to use the library you need two main things:
 				1. create an object, in the callbacks parameters there is a callback for receiving messages
 					var comm = PeerCommunication(config, callbacks); // check full documentation of paramters on the constructor header (lib/peerComm.js)
 				2. use the object to send messages
 					comm.sendToPeer(peerId, msg); // check full documentation of paramters on the function header(lib/peerComm.js)
