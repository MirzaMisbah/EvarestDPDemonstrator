# How to set up repository access without login

If you do not do anything special, every time you run `git pull` or the like which deals with cloud repository, you would need to enter your credentials to authenticate. However, it is possible to set up so called "key access", where instead of your login the git program automatically uses a cryptographic key in order to authenticate.

This is also a necessary part of automated updating of tucana website.

Here instructions are given for how to set up such access on Ubuntu OS. Additions for other systems are welcome!

## Instructions

Note: these instructions are designed for speed of setting up things. In production, a bit more secure approach should be taken.

1. [Generate your SSH key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key). For completly automated access to repository, do not enter passphrase. Use `misc/generate_key.sh`.

1. [Add your key to the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key). You do not need to install anything for clipboard copying and pasting - you can simply copy and paste the key that you generated from the output of the script of `misc/generate_key.sh`. Example output that you need to copy:

```bash
ssh-rsa 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 iaroslav@iaroslav-desktop
```

3. Clone your repository using `ssh` url: `git@github.com:InformationServiceSystems/tucana.git`. 

In order to work with ssh access, you need to clone the repository over the address `git@github.com:InformationServiceSystems/tucana.git`. If you clone over `https` url, the automated login will not work!
